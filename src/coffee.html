            which is carefully roasted. Our coffee is fruity, 
            juicy and never boring. We bring you the best 
            from leading european specialty roasteries, 
            currently mostly from <a href="">Square Mile Coffee Roasters</a>, 
            a multi award winning coffee roasting company

                        incredibly juicy coffee which we struggled to decide 
                        on the right berry descriptor, but raspberry, 
                        blackberry and blueberry were also in the running! </p>
